Version of Blendlauncher ported to Visual Studio Community 2015

Blendlauncher is a small project of mine to act as a simple launcher for Blender Game Engine, much like Unity's default launcher. 
It allows you to set essential things like window mode and resolution as well as limited options.

Essentially it's a UI for Blender's command line arguments.
